This is a small project I am building to sharpen my DevOps skills. The focus is on DevOps and not python.
I am following Miguel Grinberg flask guide here: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world

With this app, I'll be working on the following:

Automated builds: AWS CodeBuild
                  Jenkins
                  Google Cloud Build
                  GoCD

Deployments: EC2 instance
             GCP VM instance
             Docker Swarm
             AWS Elastic Container Server
             Kubernetes

Pipelines: AWS CodeDeploy
           Jenkins
           AWS CodePipeline
           Google Cloud Build
           Good old bash
